# Yi 4k and 4k+ Cameras

It's a nice camera but it has no documentation anywhere. It uses an ambarella SOC and has two operating systems which run at the same time on it: an RTOS and Linux. The RTOS does everything (encoding, the gui on the camera, etc...) while the linux barely does anything (it hosts a web server and some software that passes commands received from the network or bluetooth to the RTOS).

In this repo there is:

[4k](4k/) Stuff for the yi 4k.

[4k+](4k+/) Stuff for the yi 4k+....
